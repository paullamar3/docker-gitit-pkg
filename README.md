# Docker Container for *Gitit*

This is the source I am using to create a *Docker* image that I can then use to instantiate 
containers for *Gitit* wikis. This container is not appropriate for a public facing wiki. 
I use these containers to host wikis for my internal network to assist in development of new wiki posts 
or simply to help organize my own thoughts and notes.

See [Container Notes](docs/Container Notes.md) for detailed descriptions of features and usage instructions.
