The command to run the container:
   docker run -it -p 80:5001  --name myName paullamar3/gigitpkg:v0.2

In the container, if we are running gitit in the foreground we should kill it with a <C-C>. A <C-Z> stops the process but will not kill the process. (Use kill -KILL {PID} to kill a gitit process stopped with <C-C>.)
